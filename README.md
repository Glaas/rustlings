# Rustlings ðŸ¦€ - Glaas fork


## Heya !
This is my own fork of the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project, a fun way to get familiar with the Rust programming language.

This repository isn't intented for contribution, only to have my own space for practice.

If you're interested in learning Rust, check out those resources instead !


- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online
- And of course [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) !
